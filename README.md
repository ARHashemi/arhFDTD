## Complex Photonic Structures Finite-Difference Time-Domain

*cpsFDTD* is a  C++ package for cumputational electrodynamics based on FDTD method.

## Features and Functionalities

- Basic 3D FDTD scheme
- Flexible with different types of material by introducing their optical,
  electrical and magnetic coefficients
- Facilities for designing complicated structures
- Drude-Lorentz model for dispersive and metallic materials
- The Latest version of absorbing boundary condition,
  i.e., convolutional frequency shifted perfectly matched layer (CFS-PML)
- Periodic boundary conditions
- Total-field scattered-field technique with arbitrary orientable incident beam
- Gaussian beam profile
- Three/Four level lasers
- Flexible linear, plane, circular (arc) and spherical output ports
- Parallel computations on CPU
- Visual facilities for illustrating field/intensity distribution on output ports
- Export image and video
